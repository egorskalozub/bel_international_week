# Phone controlled car
We are team team of 4 people. We are doing the project called "Phone controlled car". 
It is a remote-controlled vehicle that can be operated through a website.
The website communicates with the car's on-board electronics and allows the user to control its movements, such as forward, backward, left, right, and stop.
This type of car is an excellent example of the integration of technology and toys, providing an exciting and interactive experience for both children and adults.
With the ability to control the car from a distance, users can explore their environment and experiment with different driving styles and speeds.
